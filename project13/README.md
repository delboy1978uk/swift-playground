Using UIImagePickerController and UISlider and some Core Image
## building the interface

- drag a `UIView` into the controller
- give the new view a width of 375 and height of 470, with X:0 and Y:64
- give the view the background color "Dark Gray Color"
- create an image view, and place it inside the view you just created
- indent it by 10 points on every side â€“ i.e., width 355, height 450, X:10, Y:10
- change the image's view mode from "Scale to fill" to "Aspect Fit"
- creating a label with width 72, height 21, X:16, Y:562

- drop a slider next to it, giving it width 262, X:96, Y:558
- add a button 120 wide and 44 high, with X:16, Y:605
